# Create a Tuple:How do you create a tuple with the following elements: "red", "green", "blue"?
# colour=("red", "green", "blue")
# print (colour)



# Access Elements in a Tuple:How do you access the first and last elements in the tuple colors = ("red", "green", "blue", "yellow")?
# colour=("red", "green", "blue", "yellow")
# range(0,3)
# print (colour)


# Immutable Nature of Tuples:What happens if you try to change the second element of the tuple colors = ("red", "green", "blue")?
# we can not change



# Tuple Unpacking:Given the tuple coordinates = (10, 20, 30), write a Python program to unpack it into three variables x, y, and z.
#


# Check Element in Tuple:Write a Python program to check if the element "blue" is present in the tuple colors = ("red", "green", "blue").
# colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
# print("blue" in colors)


# Tuple Length:Write a Python program to find the length of the tuple days = ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday").
days = ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
t=len(days)
print(t)
