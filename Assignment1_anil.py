# 1.Define a variable as Integer(1) ,Float(1.0) and String(‘1’) and print and return the value and type of variable.
# Variable
# x=10
# print("type of Variable",type (x),x)
#
# y=11.9
# print("type of Variable",type (y),y)
#
# a='student'
# print("type of Variable",type (a),a)


# 2.Redeclare the same variable as another number.(2,2.0 and ‘2’) and share your observation on result.
# x,y,z=2,2.0,"2"
# print(x,y,z)



# 3. Assigning a single value to several variables simultaneously with “=” operators.(a=b=c=10) and print the values of a,b and c..

# a=10
# b=10
# c=10
#
# print(a,b,c)


# 4.Assign two variables a and b as integer and print the sum of a+b.
# a=2
# b=3
# print(a+b)



# 5.Write a Python program to create a list with five different fruits. eg:fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]?
# fruits=["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
# print(fruits)


# 6. How do you access the second and fourth elements from the list.
# range(2,4)



# 7.Modify the third element in the list numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] to 35.
# list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# list = len (list)
# print(list)
# list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# list[2]=35
# print(list)
