# Question 1: Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs the following operations:
# x= 5
# y= 4
# a = int(x)
# b= int(y)
# # # Addition
# print("The Sum:",a+b)
#
# print("The Subtraction:",a-b)
#
# print("The Multiplication:",a*b)
#
# print("The Division:",a/b)
#
# print("The Modulus:",a%b)

# # Display the results for each operation.

#  Question 2: Write a Python program that checks whether a given number is even or odd using the modulus operator.


# x= int(input("Enter A integer Number:"))
# if(x%2)==0:
#     print("the number is even")
# else: print("the number is odd")



#  Question 3: Write a Python program that takes a number as input from the user and checks if it is positive, negative, or zero.

# x= int(input("Enter A Number:"))
# if x>0:
#     print("the number is Positive")
# elif x<0:
#     print("the number is Negative")
# else:
#     print("the number is Zero")



#  Question 4: Write a Python program that calculates the grade of a student based on the marks entered by the user. The grading scale is as follows:

# # 90 and above: A
# # 80 - 89: B
# # 70 - 79: C
# # 60 - 69: D
# # Below 60: F

# x= int(input("Enter student marks:"))
# if x>=90:
#     print("the grade of a student is A")
#
# elif x<=80 to 89:
#     print("the grade of a student is B ")
#
# elif x<=60:
#     print("the grade of a student is F ")
# else:
#     print("the number is Zero")


# Question 5: Write a Python program to create a text file called sample.txt and write the sentence "Hello, this is a sample file." to the file. Then, read and display the content from the file.
# x= "hello"
# print(x)

# Question 6: Write a Python program that reads a text file called data.txt and counts the number of words in the file.

# t = open("C:\\anilnewcode1\\data.txt","r")
# print(t.read())




# Question 7: Write a Python program to print the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
# for x in range(1,11):
#     print(x)


# Question 8: Write a Python program to display the multiplication table of a number entered by the user using a for loop.
# x= int(input("enter number:"))
# y= int(input("enter number of rows:"))
# for z in range(1,y+1):
#   multi = x*z
#   print(f"{x}*{z}={multi}")
